**Project Title: User Authentication System with JSP, Servlet, JDBC, and MySQL**

**Project Overview:**
The User Authentication System is a web-based application that provides secure and efficient user registration and login functionality. Built using Java technologies such as JSP (JavaServer Pages), Servlets, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL database, this project ensures a robust and scalable solution for managing user authentication.

**Key Features:**

1. **User Registration:**
   - New users can easily register by providing essential information such as username, email, and password.
   - The registration form includes validation checks to ensure data integrity.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before storage in the MySQL database.

2. **User Login:**
   - Registered users can log in using their credentials.
   - Authentication is handled securely to protect user accounts from unauthorized access.
   - Sessions are managed to keep users logged in during their active sessions.

3. **Database Integration:**
   - The project utilizes JDBC to connect to a MySQL database for storing user information.
   - SQL queries are used to interact with the database for user registration and authentication.

4. **User Interface:**
   - The front-end is designed using JSP to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
   - Responsive and user-friendly interfaces for both registration and login processes.

**Development Stack:**
- **Backend:** Java, Servlets, JDBC
- **Frontend:** JSP, HTML, CSS
- **Database:** MySQL

**Setup Instructions:**
1. Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
2. Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the project.
3. Deploy the project on a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

**Usage:**
1. Navigate to the registration page to create a new user account.
2. Use the login page to access your account by providing the correct credentials.

**Security Considerations:**
- Passwords are securely hashed using industry-standard algorithms.
- Input validation is implemented to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

**Note:**
This project serves as a foundational structure for user authentication in Java web applications. Developers can extend and customize the system based on specific requirements and integrate additional security measures.
